## Story of Embargo: The Final Hope

Urgent news has arrived: Zorg forces are on their way, and they're coming for us. They've discovered how close we are to completing the research that could turn the tide of this war. This is humanity’s only hope—if the city falls, our last chance for survival goes with it.

Commander Reyes, now standing as the city's last line of defense, must protect the Capitol at all costs. The Zorg are relentless, sending wave after wave of destructive forces, intent on wiping us out before the research can be finished. Machine Guns are deployed for rapid-fire suppression, Plasma Cannons to punch through their heavy armor, while Attack Boosters amplify firepower and Nano Reparators frantically keep the defenses intact.

The Zorg advance, and each wave grows deadlier. The Capitol's survival is crucial—should it fall, humanity's fate will be sealed. You must stand strong, Commander. The final battle is upon us, and everything depends on your strategy. Can you repel the Zorg invasion and buy enough time for the research to be completed, or will this be the end of mankind's last hope?
