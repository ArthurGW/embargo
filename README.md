## Story of Embargo: The Final Stand

The alien Skar'la invasion has left Earth in ruins, with humanity pushed to the brink of extinction. In the last surviving city of Rylos, Commander Reyes is the only thing standing between total annihilation and survival. The mission: defend City Hall—the heart of Earth's last government—against wave after wave of the alien horde.

Armed with Machine Guns for swift, general-purpose fire and Plasma Cannons to pierce through the Skar'la's heavy armour, Reyes places his defences carefully. Attack Boosters increase turret power, while Nano Reparators frantically repair the crumbling fortifications. But the aliens are relentless—each wave deadlier than the last, culminating in the approach of a massive alien warship known as the Overseer.

The fate of Rylos teeters on a knife's edge. The invaders are closing in, and the city's defences are stretched to the limit. Now, with the Skar'la bearing down and the Overseer looming over the battlefield, the outcome is uncertain. The final stand is yet to come. The future of humanity is in your hands—will you rally the city's defences and turn the tide, or will the alien onslaught bring Rylos to its knees? The battle for Earth's survival begins now.
